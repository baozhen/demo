I entered the room 　　 
sat by your bed all through the night 　　 
I watched your daily fight 　　 
I hardly knew 　　 
The pain 　　 
was almost more than I could bear 　　 
and still I hear 　　 
your last words to me 　　 
Heaven is a place nearby 　　 
so I won't be so far away 　　 
and if you try and look for me 　　 
maybe you'll find me someday 　 
Heaven is a place nearby 　 
so there's no need to say goodbye 　　 
I wanna ask you not to cry 　 
I'll always be by your side 　 
you just faded away 　 
you spread your wings you had flown 
away to something unknow 
wish I could bring you back 　 
you're always on my mind 　 
about to tear myself apart 　 
you have your special place in my heart 　　 
always 　　 
Heaven is a place nearby 　 
so I won't be so far away 　　 
and if you try and look for me 　　 
maybe you'll find me someday 　 
Heaven is a place nearby 　　 
so there's no need to say goodbye 　 
I wanna ask you not to cry 　　 
I'll always be by your side 　　 
and even when I go to sleep 　　 
I still can hear your voice 　　 
and those words 　　 
I never will forget 　 
Heaven is a place nearby 　 
so I won't be so far away 　 
and if you try and look for me 　 
maybe you'll find me someday 　 
Heaven is a place nearby 　　 
so there's no need to say goodbye 
I wanna ask you not to cry 　 
I'll always be by your side
